Whether you build apps or complex, distributed software, Kankoda can help. Here are some of our own apps and license-based software.

Don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}) if you need help with apps in particular or software in general, or if you want to build something great from scratch. 


## [KeyboardKit]({{site.keyboardkit}})

The [KeyboardKit]({{site.keyboardkit}}) SDK helps you build amazing custom keyboard for iOS and iPadOS, that look and behave just like the native keyboards, or completely different.

The [KeyboardKit Pro]({{site.keyboardkit}}/pro) SDK is a commercial extension that extends KeyboardKit with pro features. There is also a [KeyboardKit app]({{site.keyboardkit}}/app) on the App Store, that lets your create your own keyboards.


## [LicenseKit]({{site.licensekit}})

The [LicenseKit]({{site.licensekit}}) SDK helps you manage software licenses for your [Swift]({{site.swift}})-based apps and libraries.

LicenseKit lets you manage license information with code or text files that that are bundled with your source code, or by making remote calls to any external API or license server. 


## [Wally]({{site.wally}})

[Wally]({{site.wally}}) is an app for iOS and iPadOS, that lets you store your bank cards, loyalty cards, receipts, etc. in a wallet that is protected with your biometric information, using Face ID or Touch ID.

Wally was the first app we ever made for iOS, way back in 2012. It has continuously been upgraded to support the latest technologies, and is today using the latest version of [SwiftUI]({{site.swiftui}}).


## [Misc. Apps]({{site.appstore_url}})

Kankoda has many other apps on the [App Store]({{site.appstore_url}}), but since we have focused more on client and open-source projects, as well as our commercial SDKs, most of our apps are smaller and free.
