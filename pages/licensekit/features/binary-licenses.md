Binary licenses is a great alternative when you need to ship your licenses with your product. Licenses are compiled into binary code and can be validated even when offline.

## How does it work?

Binary licenses may sound complicated, but is actually very easy. You just define your licenses with source code and pass it into the license engine when you set up LicenseKit.

Since binary licenses are built into the product binary, you must release new product versions to add, remove and edit licenses.

## License expiration

You can choose if a license should expire on its expiration date, or if you want your customer to be able to keep using it in all versions where the license was active.

The model you choose really depends on your business model. Companies like Sketch let you use expired licenses, with hope that new features will make you renew your license.
