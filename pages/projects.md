Whether you build apps or complex, distributed software, Kankoda can help. Here are some of our most recent projects, where we have helped as an external agency or as a part of the organization.

Don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}) if you need help with apps in particular or software in general, or if you want to build something great from scratch. 


## Cineasterna

Kankoda helped [Cineasterna]({{site.cineasterna}}) bring their video streaming app to iOS, iPadOS and tvOS, as well as Android. The app features shelf- and grid-based lists, search and a native video player integration.

The app was built from scratch in [Swift]({{site.swift}}) and [SwiftUI]({{site.swiftui}}), as well as in [Kotlin]({{site.kotlin}}) and [Jetpack Compose]({{site.jetpack}}) for Android. It uses [SPM]({{site.spm}}) to share code and components across platforms.


## Oribi

[Oribi]({{site.oribi}}) is a Swedish company with amazing language technologies and products, that hired Kankoda to build a custom keyboard app for iOS and iPadOS, using Kankoda's [KeyboardKit]({{site.keyboardkit}}) SDK.

The resulting [oKeyboard]({{site.oribi}}apps/okeyboard/) app uses [KeyboardKit Pro]({{site.keyboardkitpro}}) for pro features and has its own Oribi-based autocomplete, word prediction, spellchecking, text-to-speech, license management, etc.

![Oribi Writer]({{site.assets}}screenshots/oribiwriter.png){:class="plain" width="500"}

The [SPM]({{site.spm}})-based architecture that was set up alongside oKeyboard made it easy to then rebuild the [OribiWriter]({{site.oribi}}apps/oribi-writer/) app to a modern, document-based [Swift]({{site.swift}}) and [SwiftUI]({{site.swiftui}}) app for iOS, iPadOS and macOS.


## Software Engineer

Kankoda has helped companies like [Bambuser]({{site.bambuser}}) and [Qapital]({{site.qapital}}) with lead and engineer roles, in both shorter and longer projects.
