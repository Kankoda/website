Whether you build apps or complex, distributed software, [Kankoda can help](mailto:{{site.email}}). Here are some recent projects, where Kankoda has helped as an external agency or as part of the organization.


## Cineasterna

Kankoda has developed the [Cineasterna]({{site.cineasterna}}) video streaming app for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS and Android. The app features shelf- and grid-based lists, search and native video player integration.

The apps are built in [Swift]({{site.swift}}) and [SwiftUI]({{site.swiftui}}), as well as in [Kotlin]({{site.kotlin}}) and [Jetpack Compose]({{site.jetpack}}). The Swift apps use [SPM]({{site.spm}}) to share code and components across platforms.


## Oribi

[Oribi]({{site.oribi}}) is a Swedish lang tech company that asked Kankoda to build a custom Oribi keyboard for iOS and iPadOS, using the [KeyboardKit]({{site.keyboardkit}}) SDK.

The resulting [oKeyboard]({{site.oribi}}apps/okeyboard/) app uses [KeyboardKit Pro]({{site.keyboardkitpro}}) together with Oribi-based autocomplete, word prediction, spellcheck, text-to-speech, license management, etc.

![Oribi Writer]({{site.assets}}screenshots/oribiwriter.png){:class="plain" width="500"}

The [SPM]({{site.spm}})-based architecture that was set up alongside oKeyboard made it easy to then rebuild the [OribiWriter]({{site.oribi}}apps/oribi-writer/) app to a modern, document-based [Swift]({{site.swift}}) and [SwiftUI]({{site.swiftui}}) app for iOS, iPadOS and macOS.


## Software Engineer

Kankoda has helped companies like [Bambuser]({{site.bambuser}}) and [Qapital]({{site.qapital}}) with lead and engineer roles, in both shorter and longer projects.
