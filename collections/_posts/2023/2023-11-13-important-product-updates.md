As Kankoda creates more products, having separate sites and social media accounts for each product is not viable. These sites and accounts will therefore be merged with Kankoda's.

{% include kankoda/data/product.html name="LicenseKit" %}

![LicenseKit header]({{page.image}})

The affected products will be converted to product pages on the Kankoda website. News about these products will be posted on Kankoda's [Twitter]({{site.twitter_url}}) and [Mastodon]({{site.mastodon_url}}) accounts and the [Kankoda blog](/blog). 

The products will not have separate GitHub accounts, but instead move into the [Kankoda account]({{site.github_url}}).

This change applies to [LicenseKit](/licensekit), which means that [the old LicenseKit website](https://getlicensekit.com) is now a [product page](/licensekit) on this website, and the GitHub account is now found [here]({{site.github_url}}/LicenseKit) from now on.

This change will for now not apply to [KeyboardKit](https://keyboardkit.com), [Appamini](https://appamini.com) or [Wally](https://wally.app), which for now keeps their own websites and accounts.
