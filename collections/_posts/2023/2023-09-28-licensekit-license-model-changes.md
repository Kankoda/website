The [LicenseKit]({{site.licensekit}}) license model has been updated to be more affordable for single indie developers and smaller startups, while also providing more functionality.

LicenseKit is now **$99/year** for solo indies with max $100k in annual revenue, and **$1,000/year** for startups with max 5 people and max $500k in annual revenue.

The license model has also been tweaked so that all tiers include all functionality. This means that there are no longer a hard cap on the number of licenses you can manage on the lower tiers.

We hope that indie developers and startups will like this change to the business model, and look forward to growing together.
