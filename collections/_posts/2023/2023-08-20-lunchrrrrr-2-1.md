Lunchrrrrr has been rewritten for iOS 16. It has an updated UI and improved responsiveness when dragging a card from the deck.

{% include kankoda/data/app.html name="Lunchrrrrr" %}

{% include kankoda/grids/grid-screenshots.html images="lunchrrrrr-iphone-1,lunchrrrrr-iphone-2,lunchrrrrr-iphone-3" %}

Although this app was mostly created for fun, without any business ambitions, it's a well-crafted app that uses an SDK to render the deck of cards and an API layer to integrate with the Yelp API.

When creating this new version, a lot of code could be removed due to new capabilities in the various libraries that the app uses, that have been upgraded since this app was last updated.

To try out the latest changes in Lunchrrrrr, [download the app from the AppStore]({{app.appStoreUrl}}), or checkout the [app page]({{app.url}}) for more info.
