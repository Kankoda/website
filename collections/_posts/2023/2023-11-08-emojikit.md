Say hello to [EmojiKit](/emojikit) - a brand new SDK brings emoji features to Swift-based apps and libraries on all major Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS).

EmojiKit was just released as a first 0.1 beta version. There are still work being done on the logo, the header, demo apps, etc. but you can find out more information about it on [the product site](/emojikit).
