## Binary licenses

[LicenseKit's](/licensekit) can compile licenses into the product binary. This is a great alternative when you need to ship your licenses together with your product, e.g. to be validated even when offline.


## How does it work?

This may sound complicated, but is actually very easy. You just define your licenses with code that is compiled into the binary as part of building your product.

Since binary licenses are compiled into the binary, you must release new versions of your software to add, remove and edit licenses.

You can choose if a license should expire on its expiration date, or if you want your customer to be able to keep using it in all versions where the license was active.
