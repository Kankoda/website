## Licenses

[LicenseKit](/licensekit) can provide and validate licenses that can define expiration date, features, tier, bundle IDs, supported platforms & environments, and much more.

## License Providers

LicenseKit can compile licenses into the product binary, read licenses from files, fetch licenses from remote APIs, integrate with external services like Gumroad, etc.


## Documentation
